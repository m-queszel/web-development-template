After creating and pulling the repository, make sure to run `npm install` as this will read all dependencies listed in the .json files and install them into a node_modules folder.

Additionally, you can run `npx webpack serve` to run a local development server that updates anytime files in src are saved.

I recommend using a terminal multiplexer to run your local server as it's much easier to have all your code and your development server in one place.
